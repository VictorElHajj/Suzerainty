Tectonics notes:
Subduction: The thinner of the two plates goes under always (ocean plates are always thinner than land plates, maybe add a random variation within that too)
Causes border tiles on the thin side to become lower and on the thick side to become higher

What about the opposite, plates moving away from eachother?

What about plates grinding along eachother? Is that just a weaker subduction or opposite depending on relative directions and velocity?

Idea:

Start by assigning tiles to continents, with a initial pangea of connected continental plates surrounded by ocean plates.
Each place is actually detached from the grid, the points rotate along the sphere. Use some fluid dynamics -ish logic so that the points making up the continents are pulled together if drifting apart and away if too close, and when points of two different continents interact use the above logic.
