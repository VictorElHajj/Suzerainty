Add tile drawing gizmo member method, adapt it for tile height
Store tile height seperately (need to be able to retrieve when drawing tile selection, currently this is instead taken from the sphere resource, which does not know about this.)
Store my own vertices and recreate when height changes?

Then refactor!!

Then start on continents
